# Cookiejar
Operational System work in java, the problem:
Question: A cookie jar is being shared by two sisters, Tina and Judy, using the following rule: 
Judy can get a cookie from the jar only after Tina (being the older sister) gets a cookie in at 
least two separate occasions, whereas Tina gets a cookie from the jar whenever she wants to.
The mother is alerted by Judy or Tina whenever they want to eat a cookie and the jar is empty, 
in which case the mother fills the jar up (from a hidden source), and the kids go on eating. 
Treating Tina, Judy and the mother as three independently executing 
processes and the Cookie Jar as a shared resource, develop a concurrent algorithm to solve 
the Finite-Source Cookie Jar Problem.
